# IoT Data Pipeline – Course Project

This repository contains my IoT data pipeline project for the **Implementing IoT Pipeline** course.

The course consists of two parts:
- an AI/ML–related task
- a main project

The main project developed during the course is **Silka**, a safety mobile application.  
Due to the nature of the project, the Silka repository is private and can only be accessed with authorization.
