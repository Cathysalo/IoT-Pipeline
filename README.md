# IoT Data Pipeline – Course Project

This repository contains my coursework for the **Implementing IoT Pipeline** course.

It shows how an IoT data pipeline is **planned, built, documented, tested, secured, and prepared for presentation** during the course.

## Project Context

The **Implementing IoT Pipeline** course focuses on learning how IoT systems are developed using good engineering practices.

Key areas of focus include:

- organizing a technical project
- writing clear documentation
- testing and validation
- basic security considerations
- deployment and presentation

All **public coursework and required deliverables** for the course are maintained in this repository.

---

## Project Scope

The course consists of two main parts:

- an **AI / ML–related task**
- a **main IoT pipeline project**

This repository contains:

- course documentation and notes
- AI / ML coursework
- IoT pipeline design and descriptions
- testing, security, and deployment documentation

🔒 The **main application source code and detailed internal documents**
are maintained in a separate **private repository** due to the sensitive nature of the project.

## Main Project: Silka

**Silka** is a safety-focused mobile application and serves as the **main project** for this course.

Because of the nature of the application:

- the Silka repository is **private**
- access can be granted to the lecturer **upon request**

This public repository is used to:

- document the IoT data pipeline
- explain design decisions
- demonstrate learning progress and deliverables for assessment

---

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I aim to:

- understand how data flows through an IoT system
- design and clearly document an IoT data pipeline
- apply testing and basic security practices
- prepare documentation suitable for deployment and presentation
- work incrementally and systematically throughout the course
