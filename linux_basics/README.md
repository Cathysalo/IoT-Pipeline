
# Linux Basics – Learning Diary (CSC)

## Summary
I studied basic Linux commands using the CSC Linux basics tutorial to understand how
CSC computing environments are used through the command line, especially on shared
systems without a graphical interface.

## What I Learned
Since I was already familiar with the Bash shell, commands such as `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`,
`mkdir`, and `mv` were familiar. This allowed me to focus on understanding how
directories and files are structured in Linux systems and how efficiently tasks can
be handled from the command line.

I practiced managing files and directories using `mkdir`, `cp`, and `mv`, viewing file
contents with `cat` and `less`, and editing files using `nano`.
I also worked with basic data-processing commands like `grep`, `sort`, and `uniq`, 
and practiced combining commands using pipes (`|`) to process text-based data faster.

## Practice Environment
I practiced these commands on an Ubuntu virtual machine using VirtualBox, for hands-on experience.

## Reflection
This task reinforced my existing Bash knowledge and improved my understanding of how
Linux is used in shared computing environments like CSC.
Practicing in Ubuntu increased my confidence in working from the command line.
